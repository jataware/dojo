      "paragraph": "In rural Ghana, 62% of the population relies on agriculture, forestry and/or fishing for their livelihood (Ghana Statistical Service, 2016). In Northern Ghana, rainfed agriculture is only possible six months out of the year, and agricultural households must find other livelihood sources during the long dry season. In addition, climate change trends, such as changes in seasonal rainfall patterns, more erratic rainfall, and temperature increases are already straining agricultural production and these trends are predicted to continue or worsen into the future (Laube et al., 2012). The impact of climate change is exacerbated by population growth, which places pressure on agricultural land and fuelwood, resulting in deforestation, overgrazing, bushfires, soil degradation and other environmental challenges (Laube et al., 2012)."

      "paragraph": "Even though sub-Saharan Africa does not contribute significantly to GHG emissions compared with other regions, adverse impacts of climate change are anticipated in this region, particularly in West African countries since they are heavily dependent on rain-fed agriculture. The impact of climate change on agriculture is manifested in four main ways: rising temperatures, declining rainfall totals and increased variability, rising sea levels, and high incidence of weather extremes and disasters. The distribution of rainfall is considered the single most important factor affecting agriculture in Ghana (Government of Ghana, 2010). Reduced and increasingly erratic rainfall in the country's ecological zones has adverse effects on the agricultural economy and livelihoods because agriculture in Ghana is largely rain-fed."

In the traditional conceptual model of agriculture's contribution to development, very poor smallholder producers grow staple crops largely for their own consumption. They suffer income and caloric deficits that can be remedied by increased production, some of which is taken to market for cash sales and some of which is consumed to meet minimal caloric needs. The increased income is spent on locally produced goods and services, which generates new jobs in the community and demand for labor. This conceptual framing trained its focus on increased productivity of food staples. For this reason, many development programs, national research institutes, and the early period of investment in CGIAR emphasized increased productivity of staples."

      "paragraph": "PNG's unique and highly varied biophysical landscape has shaped agricultural production patterns, outcomes and livelihoods for centuries. Starchy staples such as sweet potato, yam, and sago have long been major sources of calories, while cash crops such as cocoa, coffee and copra are an important part of household livelihood strategies. Imported food commodities, including rice and vegetable oil, are also critical for household food security, especially in urban areas. This complex food system in many ways mitigates welfare risk for PNG producers and consumers, with a growing share of households linking to diversified sources of income. However, for a large share of the rural population who remain in remote areas with limited access to diversified food systems, a climate shock can present significant risk to food security resulting in a need for quick policy action and an informed investment and food-aid implementation plan."

      "paragraph": "It is in this challenging context that climate change will take place with potentially significant adverse effects for the agriculture sector. The existing literature indicates that climate change will affect people's food security and livelihoods by reducing farm production and deteriorating the general conditions in which smallholder farmers operate and by reducing the availability of food products. In particular, climate change is expected to adversely reduce rice production in all three growing seasons and have significant negative impacts on fisheries due to the increased intensity and frequency of extreme events, such as coastal cyclones and flooding (Ruane et al. 2013). In addition to the direct effects on crop productivity, new research finds that climate change will also affect the nutritional value of food products (Fanzo et al. 2017) and that some grains and legumes have lower concentrations of zinc and iron when grown under elevated CO2 concentrations (Myers et al, 2014). Bangladesh's geographical exposure and the sensitivity of its farmers to the vagaries of the weather make Bangladesh one of the most vulnerable countries to the impacts of climate change."

      "paragraph": "Ghanaian cuisine is mainly composed by cereals, starchy roots and plantain and the main staples in the study area are maize, millet, sorghum and yam (FAO, 2009). Roots and tubers account for a large share of the national food supply and are used to produce staple dishes such as fufu, banku, and kenkey. Fish is the most important source of animal protein, and it is commonly consumed in a dried and smoked form. The main challenges for Ghana's agricultural sector are the lack of infrastructure, low productivity due to the dependence on rain-fed agriculture and the lack of access to credit and inputs. Furthermore, Ghana's agricultural sector is also threatened by climate change, as variations in rainfall patterns and rising temperatures are expected to affect crop yields and productivity."

      "paragraph": "Research suggests that climate change will significantly affect the availability, accessibility, and stability of food supply in Ghana, and the situation may be worse for the country’s vulnerable populations (EPA Ghana, 2015). Even though some regions might experience an increase in crop production due to climate change, the overall impact is expected to be negative. Increasing temperatures, changes in rainfall patterns and the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events are likely to reduce crop yields, increase the incidence of pest and disease outbreaks, and lead to land degradation and loss of biodiversity. These changes will not only affect food production but also the livelihoods of smallholder farmers who depend on agriculture for their income and subsistence."

      "paragraph": "Farmers in Ghana are already experiencing the impacts of climate change, which is manifesting in the form of prolonged dry spells, erratic rainfall, intense storms, and increasing temperatures. These climatic changes have direct and indirect effects on agricultural productivity, food security, and rural livelihoods. To mitigate these impacts and adapt to the changing climate, farmers are employing a variety of strategies. These include diversifying income sources, changing cropping patterns and practices, investing in irrigation, and adopting improved crop varieties and livestock breeds. However, the effectiveness of these strategies is limited by several factors, including lack of access to credit, inadequate extension services, and poor infrastructure. Addressing these challenges is crucial for enhancing the resilience of agricultural systems and ensuring food security in Ghana."

This makes them highly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, particularly changes in rainfall patterns and increased temperatures. The government of Ghana has recognized the threat of climate change to agriculture and has implemented various policies and programs to address the issue. These initiatives aim to promote sustainable agricultural practices, improve access to credit and inputs, and enhance the capacity of farmers to adapt to climate change. Despite these efforts, many challenges remain, including inadequate funding, limited technical capacity, and poor infrastructure. Addressing these challenges is essential for building a resilient agricultural sector that can withstand the impacts of climate change and contribute to food security in Ghana."

  "answer": "The primary staple foods in Ghana are maize, millet, sorghum, and yam, with roots and tubers accounting for about 60% of the total value of home consumption [6]. Climate change is expected to have a significant impact on agriculture in Ghana, particularly because the country is heavily dependent on rain-fed agriculture [0][1]. Changes in seasonal rainfall patterns, more erratic rainfall, and temperature increases are already straining agricultural production and these trends are predicted to continue or worsen into the future [0]. The impact of climate change on agriculture is manifested in four main ways: rising temperatures, declining rainfall totals and increased variability, rising sea levels, and high incidence of weather extremes and disasters [1]. Cereal production, which includes crops like maize, millet, and sorghum, is projected to be about 6 percent less than it would have been in the absence of climate change by 2030 and 10 percent less by 2050 [7].",
