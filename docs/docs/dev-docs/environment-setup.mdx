# Environment Setup

This page details how to configure the [dojo-stack environment file](https://github.com/jataware/dojo-stack/blob/main/envfile.sample)

Initially, upon first clone of the code, running `make init` will create an `envfile` file from `envfile.sample`.

Common variables to modify:

```
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=
BUCKET=
DMC_BUCKET=
DOCKERHUB_AUTH=
DOCKERHUB_USER=
STORAGE_HOST=
CONFIG_STORAGE_BASE=s3://dojo/configs/
DATASET_STORAGE_BASE_URL=s3://datasets/
DOCUMENT_STORAGE_BASE_URL=s3://documents/
```

```python
# TODO Proper Overview on what values to use for development vs production
```

When working exclusively within Docker and changing values in the `envfile`, a simple `make restart` from the project directory will:
1) Re-generate a docker-compose file with all the services and latest updated values from the `envfile`
2) Restart all currently running services to use these settings
3) Start any services that were stopped before the restart command
