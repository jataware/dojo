# Make and Docker Integration

Developers familiar with Docker and docker-compose might be surprised to find that the `docker-compose.yaml` file at the root of the repo is programmatically generated and updated
by the `make` build tasks.

Each service contains its own docker-compose.yaml details:
- ui/docker-compose.yaml
- api/docker-compose.yaml
- dmc/docker-compose.yaml
- tasks/docker-compose.yaml
- workers/docker-compose.yaml
- testmos/docker-compose.yaml
- terminal/docker-compose.yaml

Additionally, an overrides file contains any changes modified for local development or production:
`docker-compose.build-override.yaml`

The `make` task `docker-compose.yaml` stitches together the `envfile` and the above `*/docker-compose*` files into the final docker-compose.yaml file.

The docker-compose file is regenerated under certain conditions, which can be understood by examining the `Makefile`. Alternatively, you can manually run `make docker-compose.yaml` to regenerate it by hand. Docker-compose regeneration is usually only relevant in specific situations, such as when:
* Modifying the envfile values
* Modifying */docker-compose* files as part of a service while developing a new feature
* Customizing environment values for production deployment, or in other specific scenarios
