# Make and Docker Integration

Developers familar with Docker and docker-compose might be surprised to find that the docker-compose.yaml on the root of the repo is programmatically generated, and updated,
by the `make` build tasks.

Each service contains it's own docker-compose.yaml details:
- ui/docker-compose.yaml
- api/docker-compose.yaml
- dmc/docker-compose.yaml
- tasks/docker-compose.yaml
- workers/docker-compose.yaml
- testmos/docker-compose.yaml
- terminal/docker-compose.yaml

Additionally, an overrides file contains any changes modified for local development or production:
`docker-compose.build-override.yaml`

The `make` tasks `docker-compose.yaml` stitches together the `envfile`, and the above `*/docker-compose*` files into the final docker-compose.yaml file.

Inspect the `Makefile` to understand which tasks will regenerate the docker-compose file, or manually run
```
make docker-compose.yaml
```

to do so. This is usually relevant only when a) modifying the envfile values, and b) modifying */docker-compose* files as part of a service while developing a new feature.
Additionally, there may be other ocassions, such as customizing env values for production deployment.
