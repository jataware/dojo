# Developer Workflow

Or, A Day on The Life of Dojo Developer

#### If computer restarted

```
cd ~/code/dojo
make up
```

#### Follow Important Service Logs

From terminal:

##### List services
`docker ps`

Important when services failing (ensure all services are present / started correctly)

##### Dojo API Logs
`docker logs -f dojo-api`

##### RQ Worker Logs
`docker logs --tail 100  -f dojo-rq-worker`

#### Inspecting Elasticsearch state and contents

By default, one of the docker containers started in the stack is the `Kibana` developer tool.
It'll connect to the running elasticsearch service on the default port, and allow users to inspect indexes, their document count, and use a developer notebook which issues REST requests to elasticsearch.
The "notebook" is actually Kibana's "Dev Tools" section

which allows developers to get and search documents, filter and aggregate, inspect, modify, delete, create, etc.

TODOs:
1. Link to Kibana and Elasticsearch documentation for current version
2. Share images or videos of the experience
3. Create Troubleshooting-Common-Problems.md article.

#### Troubleshooting Common Problems
See [[Troubleshooting Common Problems]] wiki article.

### Deploying to Production (!!)
See [[Production Deployment]] for requirements and steps.
