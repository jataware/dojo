# Developer Docs

This wiki is a _developer guide_ for working with the Dojo Stack.

As of 2023, the base developer setup consists of using a Makefile to generate
the \[complex\] docker-compose file and handle docker containers state (start, stop).

To that end and to get started, the following dependencies are required on the system:

- Unix system with `make` to run the Makefile commands
- docker
- docker compose plugin, usually bundled with docker.

## Developer QuickStart

The README describes three simple steps to get started without customization:

1. Clone repository
2. Run `make init`
3. run `make up`

That is it!

## First URLs to visit

The Dojo Web User Interface (Dojo UI):
`http://localhost:8080`

The Dojo API spec / swagger UI:
`http://localhost:8000`

## Where To Go From Here

### Stack Diagram and Services Overview
See [Stack Overview](./dev-docs/stack-overview).

### Customizing Setup
After trying the running app (especially the web UI), you may want to customize the
configuration. See [Environment Setup](./dev-docs/environment-setup).
