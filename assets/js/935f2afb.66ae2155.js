Please reach out to dojo@jataware.com to request access.","sidebar":"dojoSidebar"},"details/matlab":{"id":"details/matlab","title":"MATLAB Models","description":"MATLAB is a proprietary software that requires a license to use. This presents a challenge to registering models into an environment where there is no software license for MATLAB. Conveniently, MATALB offers the option to compile model code into an executable that can be run using the MATLAB Runtime. MATLAB Runtime does not reqiure a MATLAB software license. To register a MATLAB model to Dojo it must first be compiled, then executed using the Runtime.","sidebar":"dojoSidebar"},"documents":{"id":"documents","title":"Documents","description":"Document Uploader","sidebar":"dojoSidebar"},"dojo-api":{"id":"dojo-api","title":"Dojo API","description":"This document outlines how to interact with the Dojo API to fetch models, execute models, and fetch model runs.","sidebar":"dojoSidebar"},"FAQ":{"id":"FAQ","title":"Frequently Asked Questions","description":"1.
